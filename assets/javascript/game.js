//Need an event listener for keypress to start game

//Once game is started, the computer chooses at random a word from the array of words

//Blank spaces appear to the user where the chosen word would be, example "_ _ _ _ _"

//The remaining guesses begins at 13

//The letter the player guesses incorrectly appears in the already guest box

//The letter the player guesses correctly appears in the blank spot of the current word box example "_ h _"

//If the player runs out of guesses then game resets and alerts player that they have lost

//If the player finishes the word before running out of guesses then the game resets with a new word and the win counter goes up
